Emily, an ambitious twenty-something marketing executive from Chicago,
unexpectedly lands her dream job in Paris when her company acquires a French luxury marketing company.
Her life in Paris, then, is a MASS.

Season 2
Emily is confused after her affair with Gabriel and her friendship with his now ex-girlfriend Camille. 
Even worse, Emily has a weekend getaway planned for St Tropez with Mathieu. The ad account for Champere, 
Camille's family's champagne brand, goes to Luc even though Emily believes she brought the new business to Savoir. Camille shows up to discuss the marketing campaign, though she, Sylvie, and Emily go to lunch instead. 
Camille teams up with Emily for a night out at the drag bar they previously visited, where Emily's new roommate Mindy performs a solo version of BTS's "Dynamite".
